<h2 align="center">An experienced mobile application developer with flutter & native android (kotlin/java)</h2>

I'm a mobile engineer with expertise in Flutter and native Android development. I'm passionate about building user-centric applications to solve problems. I am also interested in building restful APIs with Java (Spring Boot) as well as building desktop applications with JavaFXML.

## 🔭 Previous Work
I have worked as a Mobile Engineer with several companies, where I was responsible for developing and maintaining mobile apps using Flutter. I worked closely with the backend and UX and design team to ensure that the apps look great and function seamlessly.

## 🌱 Expertise
I have expertise in the following technologies:

- Flutter: I have developed several mobile apps using Flutter, which is a popular framework for building native iOS and Android apps from a single codebase. I'm comfortable using Flutter's widget framework, state management solutions, and plugins to create performant and visually appealing mobile apps.

- Native Android: I also have experience developing native Android apps using Java/Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and the Android SDK. I'm familiar with Android's UI components, data storage options, and other platform-specific features.

## 👀 Other Interest
- Spring Boot: I am interested in developing RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework for building web applications.

- JavaFXML: I have developed desktop applications using JavaFXML, which is a Java-based framework for building rich user interfaces. I have used tools like Gluon scene Builder to create custom components and beautiful UIs.
